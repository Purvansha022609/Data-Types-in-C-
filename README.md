Data-Types-in-C++

## **THEORY**
1. Primitive Data Types: These data types are built-in or predefined data types and can be used directly by the user to declare variables. example: int, char, float, bool, etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are: 

-Integer

+Character

+Boolean
+Floating Point
+Double Floating Point
+Valueless or Void
+Wide Character

2. Derived Data Types: Derived data types that are derived from the primitive or built-in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four types namely: 

+Function
+Array
+Pointer
+Reference

3. Abstract or User-Defined Data Types: Abstract or User-Defined data types are defined by the user itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure. C++ provides the following user-defined datatypes:  

+Class
+Structure
+Union
+Enumeration
+Typedef defined Datatype

### **ALGORITHM**

Integer Types:

int: Represents signed integers (usually 4 bytes).
short: Represents short integers (usually 2 bytes).
long: Represents long integers (size varies by system).
long long: Represents very long integers (usually 8 bytes).
unsigned int: Represents unsigned integers (no negative values).
char: Represents a single character (usually 1 byte).
bool: Represents a boolean value (either true or false).
Floating-Point Types:

float: Represents single-precision floating-point numbers.
double: Represents double-precision floating-point numbers (more precision than float).
long double: Represents extended-precision floating-point numbers (size varies by system).
Other Built-in Types:

void: Represents the absence of a type. Used in function return types and pointers.
wchar_t: Represents wide characters (used for internationalization).
char16_t and char32_t: Represents characters of specific sizes for Unicode support.
User-Defined Types:

struct: Defines a composite data type containing variables (members).
class: Defines a composite data type with additional features like encapsulation and access control.
enum: Defines an enumeration type with named values.
